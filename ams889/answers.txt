iPython Questions

1. I ran the following code to establish the path:
	import os
	?os.path.abspath
The path is:
 /usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py

2. num = !ls -1 /etc | wc -l

3. As 'num' was assigned a SList format, in order to print its square root we must convert it into an integer. 
I use the following code to print the square root of 'num':
import math
print math.sqrt(int(num[0]))

4. The fastest method is x*x (at roughly 63 ns per loop) followed by x**2 (at roughly 71 ns per loop) and then numpy.square (at 1.3 microseconds per loop)

5. There are 24 cell magic commands (calculated by typing %% TAB and counting).
