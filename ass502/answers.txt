IPython

1. I first had to import os.path and then I used the command os.path.abspath? which showed that the file that contains it is /usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py


2. The command I used is num=!ls -1 /etc | wc -l


3. I found the square root of num with the command print(int(num[0])**.5)

The value I got was 15.231546211727817


4. x*x was the fastest method as it took an average of 72.2 ns whereas x**2 took 81.2 ns and numpy.square(x) took 1.72 us (microseconds).


5. There are 24 cell magic commands, as listed in %magic which has information about the magic functions.



PyDev

5. After the program finished running the Console showed the module that was run, showed that it terminated, and showed the output which was "Hello World!".
