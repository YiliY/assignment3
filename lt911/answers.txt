IPython:
1)	First  import os, then use ? to find the information of the object: ?os.path.abspath or  os.path.abspath?
The path of the file is: /usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py


2)	Number of file s in /etc: ls -1 /etc | wc –l 
Assignment :  num = !ls -1 /etc | wc –l    

3) import math
   math.sqrt(float(num.n))  = 15.231546211727817
 
Or  import numpy
	numpy.sqrt(float (num.n))

	(since the assignment stores the command value as a SList, use num.n to dislay the value as a string, 
	then use float(num) to change its type to float for further computation.)

4) 	I have tried to run the %timeit magic commands serveral times for each method. Although the best time taken 
    for a loop differed time to time, x*x always needs less time. Thus,numpy.square() is the fastest method.
    %timeit x**2

10000000 loops, best of 3: 80.5 ns per loop

%timeit x*x
10000000 loops, best of 3: 63.5 ns per loop

import numpy

%timeit numpy.square(x)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.73 µs per loop
    
    
5)	By using %lsmagic, it shows 24 available cell magic commands. 
"Available cell magics:
%%!  %%HTML  %%SVG  %%bash  %%capture  %%debug  %%file  %%html  
%%javascript  %%latex  %%perl  %%prun  %%pypy  %%python  %%python3 
%%ruby  %%script  %%sh  %%svg  %%sx  %%system  %%time  %%timeit  %%writefile"
(cited from %lsmgic)

PyDev:
5) After the using the exxtract method, the console shows exactly the same thing as what we had in the 
original hello_world.py. 
Output: Hello World!
